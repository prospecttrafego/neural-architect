# Multi-Agent Systems Methodology

This guide covers the design and implementation of autonomous multi-agent systems using frameworks like **Agno** and **CrewAI**.

## Core Concepts

- **Agents**: Autonomous entities with specific roles and goals.
- **Tools**: Capabilities given to agents (search, API access, etc.).
- **Tasks**: Units of work to be performed.
- **Process**: How agents collaborate (Sequential, Hierarchical).

## Workflow

1.  **Define the Objective**: What is the system trying to achieve?
2.  **Role Mapping**: Decompose the objective into roles.
3.  **Tool Selection**: What tools does each agent need?
4.  **Flow Design**: How do agents pass information?
5.  **Implementation**: Coding the agents and tasks.
6.  **Evaluation**: Testing agent performance and reliability.
