# Software Methodology Overview

Welcome to the Neural Architect Software Methodology. This guide provides a structured approach to building high-quality software products, specifically tailored for neurodivergent founders and power users.

## The Process

Our methodology is broken down into 7 key phases:

1.  **Problem Discovery**: deeply understanding the user's pain points.
2.  **Ideation & Validation**: generating solutions and confirming demand.
3.  **Architecture Design**: planning specific technical stack and data flow.
4.  **UI/UX Design**: creating intuitive and accessible interfaces.
5.  **Development**: implementing the solution with clean code.
6.  **Testing**: ensuring reliability and correctness.
7.  **Deployment**: launching to production.

## Why this approach?

- **Structured**: Breaks complexity into manageable chunks.
- **Visual**: Highlights progress and clear next steps.
- **Flexible**: Adapts to different types of software (SaaS, API, etc.).
